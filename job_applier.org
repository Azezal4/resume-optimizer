* I'm getting depressed customising my resume to every job I apply. I feel like my life is being wasted just on formatting. Let's do a simple math: :ATTACH:
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       b7504151-6e77-455e-a0d2-2417550b62a6
:END:
#+begin_src
  // Consider 5 job application
  5 x 20 min(Resumes, cover letters, application) = 100 min
  // I've been applying for 3 months now so,
  100 x 30 = 3000 min (i.e 50 days sad 😒) damn.....  
#+end_src
So, My goal is to reduce this time to roughly 5 minutes which in turns gives me back my 15 minutes 😃.
The architecture in my mind:

** After a careful examination, I plan to go with plan B, i.e Making this thing portable.



* Starting with docker, I'm using arch, so installation and config of the docker doesn't seem to much. I just run
#+begin_src
  sudo pacman -S docker
  systemctl start/enable docker.service
#+end_src
*/ Note: The docker service is only accessible by root user so change in permission is necessary.

#+begin_src
  sudo useradd docker // but most of the time user is already created
  sudo usermod -aG docker $USER // need to add the user to the docker group
  // check
  docker ps // should work
#+end_src

** Found something interesting on why docker need root previlages,
+ docker runs KVM
  + KVM being a hypervisor, needs the base level permission

Now, After spending 1 hour of debugging on why ollama is not being installed, i forgot yesterday exists. And Yes, yesterday yours truly tested ollama on my pc globally. Without any env or being containerized.
So what do we learn from this?
+ search for open port
+ check for any processes using that port
+ kill the damn port
After all of this, we still need to install ~nvidia-container-toolkit~ cause I have some gpu
